<h2>Description</h2>
The provided Python code defines a university management system comprising classes for Persons, Students, Faculty, and Departments. Each class encapsulates specific attributes and functionalities relevant to its role within the university structure. Persons are assigned unique "G-numbers," while students can manage grades, calculate GPAs, and determine class levels. Faculty members track tenure, rank, and specialties. The Department class oversees the addition of faculty and students, checks qualifications, and displays rosters. The code sets up a basic system to model a simplified university. It includes features for adding people, managing student grades, and organizing faculty and students into different departments.
